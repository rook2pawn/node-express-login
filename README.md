node-express-login
==================

Learn yourself a simple login with Express, Formidable, Connect-Store using Redis and EJS template. 

Installation
============

You have to install redis first. If you are on a linux system use your package manage to "install redis".

Once you have redis (which will come with redis-server, redis-cli, etc), then
    
    npm install express-login


    Then, run 
    
    node server.js 

and open your web browser to http://localhost:4000

Goals
=====

    To make a clean skeleton for login/logout/registration for others to learn from.

That's all! Have a good day.


You can see an example of this in action and a whole lot more at one of my websites http://sweetcloudsvapor.com which includes recaptcha, and I integrate with Paypal/Stripe as well.

Making full apps in Express is simple fast, and really clean.
